What is DevOps?
It's a culture that allows development and operation team to work together.It's the use of tools to envolve and release higher services to customers. 
It increases trust and faster software releases. It involves two teams:
-Development Teams:- they test code &
-Operation teams:- helps in the production environment.
It entails the collaboration of these two teams for faster software releases

Tools in DevOps
For the Development side, we have:
Building:- sbt, gradle, maven
Coding & Planning:- subversion (SVN), team foundation server (TFS), git
Testing:- Se, JUnit

for Operation side, we have:
Realease:- codeship, bamboo, jenkins
MOnitor:-splunk, datadog, Nagios
Deploy & Operate:-saltstack, DC/OS kubernetes, docker, ansible, chef

Version Control System (VCS)
It's a practice of tracking and managing software codes. It takes a snapshot of your code and saves it in a repository. Changes can easily be modified and 
if any mistake, you can match the previous code with the new one. These changes are saved in a new version.

Centralized Version control system
It uses a central server to store all the files. If the server crashes, all data of the project will be lost.

Distributed version control system
Here, a centrall sever is also used but the files are distributed to different programmers on their own local system. Updates can be made by each developer
which will reflect on the main repository. Git is an example.

What is Git
A version conrol system for tracking changes in computer files. You can store your codes remotely and aloows other developers access these remote codes.

features
-Tracks hisotry
-free open source
-supports non-linear development
-creates back-up
-scalable
-supports collaboration
-branching is easier.

Work FLow
A client pulls code copy from a server which allows him to make changes in code, update it, commit it and review it. THen, you can push the updare
code to the git server, probably under a new branch.

Branch in Git
Is used to keep changes until they are ready. Allows your main branch to be stable untle when you're done updating your code. When done, you could merge the branch
with the main branch.

Commands in git
-git init: creates a new repository 
-git push, pull, add origin: sync repositories
-git branch, merge, rebase: parallel development
-git add, commit, status: make changes



Github
It's a service where projects are stored. Every project has a unique repository.

Features
-Easy project management
-Increased safety with packages 
-Effective team management
-Improved code writing
-Increased code safety 
-Easy code hosting
